# Find_circle_A

# Question 

There exist two circular arrangements of integers circle A and circle B each of size n where
n(>3) is an integer not perfectly divisible by 3. If circle A = [a1,a2,a3,a4,. . . . . . ..an-1,an] where
a1 and an are adjacent to each other and all the elements are positive. Now circle B is initially
formed such that B = [an+a1+a2, a1+a2+a3, a2+a3+a4, . . . .., an-2+an-1+an,an-1+an+a1]. You
are given the values of circle B. Your task is to find the list which represents circle A. Expected
time complexity - O(n).
